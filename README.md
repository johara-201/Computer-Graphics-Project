# Computer Graphics Project

This project was developed as part of the **Computer Graphics** course at Braude College.  
It focuses on implementing the **algorithmic and mathematical components** of a 3D rendering engine, while a predefined framework handled the interface and visualization aspects.

## 🌈 Part 1 – Ray Tracing
Implemented a recursive ray tracing engine capable of:
- Ray–sphere intersection computation
- Diffuse, specular, and ambient lighting
- Texture mapping on 3D spheres
- Shadow detection and reflection
- Skybox background rendering

---

## 🧩 Part 2 – Rasterization
Implemented a full **graphics pipeline**, including:
- Vertex transformations (model, view, projection, viewport)
- Barycentric coordinate interpolation
- Z-buffer depth testing
- Flat, Gouraud, and Phong shading models
- Texture rendering and lighting combination

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Language:** Java  
- **Math Library:** JOML  
- **Environment:** Eclipse
